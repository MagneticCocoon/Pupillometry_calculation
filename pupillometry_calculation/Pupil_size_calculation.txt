<Pupil size calculation>

- We use pupil size (pupil diameter horizontal) as a measure of cognitive load

- Participants played two scenarios: S (Subarachnoid hemorrhage) and G (Gastrointestinal Bleeding), which will be averaged.

- Timestamps are not arranged in order: sorting needed at the beginning

- To compensate delay in pupil response, we add 300ms to the timestamps of pupil sizes (not sure how to do it now...)

- We only use Fixation R (not Fixation L) in Event Type 




1. PFE correction for all Avg.PupilSize X
	
- We correct off-axis distortion (PFE:Pupil foreshortening error)
	
- 3 values of Fixations are used: Location X, Location Y, Avg.PupilSize X
	
- Codes in PFE_correction is used



2. Baseline reduction
	
- We compensate illuminance effect by subtracting pupil size in baseline from pupil size in scenario
	
- In PA group, two baselines exist: BlockBase (baseline for play) and PauseBase (baseline for pause).
		
Block pupil size = Block pupil size - BlockBase
		
Pause pupil size = Pause pupil size - PauseBase		
	

- PlayBase:
For PA group, 
		
Starts: # Message: SAH_PlayBase_Start 
		
Ends: # Message: SAH_PauseBase_Start
	
For NP group, 
		
Starts: # Message: SAH_PlayBase_Start 
		
Ends: # Message: SAH_Scenario_Start

	

- PauseBase:
		
Starts: # Message: SAH_PauseBase_Start  
		
Ends: # Message: SAH_Scenario_Start

	
- Play:
		
Starts: # Message: SAH_Scenario_Start
		
Ends: navigate_to /game/endfeedback/
	

- Pause:
		
Starts: pause {'total':'10','paused':true,'current':x}
		
Ends: pause {'total':'10','paused':false,'current':x}
	
- In NP group, there's neither Pause or PauseBase.


3. Lastly, we compare the average pupil diameters in two groups: PA and NP
